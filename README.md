# Sentiment140 NLP Project

Project scaffold for sentiment analysis on the Sentiment140 dataset. This repository contains datasets, notebooks, modular `src/` code, model storage, visualizations, and reports to support experimentation from preprocessing through model fine-tuning and evaluation.

Structure (partial):

- `data/` — raw and processed data, embeddings
- `notebooks/` — exploratory notebooks and model experiments
- `src/` — reusable scripts to load, preprocess, featurize and train models
- `models/` — saved model artifacts and vectorizers/tokenizers
- `visuals/` — produced figures (wordclouds, confusion matrices, charts)
- `reports/` — PDF reports and presentation slides

See `requirements.txt` for core Python dependencies.
